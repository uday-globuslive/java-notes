## Mock Interview Scenarios

Below are complete mock interview scenarios that you can use for practice. Each scenario includes an algorithmic problem, follow-up questions, and expected behavioral questions.

### Scenario 1: Entry-Level Java Developer

**Technical Question: Two Sum**

Problem: Given an array of integers and a target sum, return the indices of two numbers such that they add up to the target.

Example:
- Input: nums = [2, 7, 11, 15], target = 9
- Output: [0, 1] (because nums[0] + nums[1] = 2 + 7 = 9)

**Expected Solution Approach:**
1. Brute force: Check all pairs with nested loops (O(nÂ²) time)
2. Optimized: Use a hash map to store seen values (O(n) time, O(n) space)

**Follow-up Questions:**
1. How would your solution change if there could be multiple valid pairs?
2. What if the array is sorted? Can you optimize further?
3. How would you handle very large arrays that don't fit in memory?

**Behavioral Questions:**
1. Tell me about a time when you faced a challenging programming problem. How did you solve it?
2. How do you approach learning new technologies or frameworks?
3. Describe a situation where you had to work under pressure to meet a deadline.

### Scenario 2: Mid-Level Java Developer

**Technical Question: LRU Cache**

Problem: Design and implement a Least Recently Used (LRU) cache. It should support get(key) and put(key, value) operations with O(1) time complexity.

**Expected Solution Approach:**
1. Use a combination of HashMap and DoublyLinkedList
2. HashMap for O(1) lookup
3. DoublyLinkedList to track usage order and enable O(1) removal

**Follow-up Questions:**
1. How would you make your implementation thread-safe?
2. How would you modify your design to limit the cache by size (in bytes) rather than by number of items?
3. How would you implement an LFU (Least Frequently Used) cache instead?

**Behavioral Questions:**
1. Describe a situation where you improved an existing codebase. What motivated the change and what was the outcome?
2. How do you ensure your code is maintainable and easy for others to understand?
3. Tell me about a time when you disagreed with a team member on a technical decision. How did you resolve it?

### Scenario 3: Senior Java Developer

**Technical Question: Design a Distributed Rate Limiter**

Problem: Design a rate limiter that can restrict the number of requests a user can make within a time window in a distributed environment.

**Expected Solution Approach:**
1. Discuss centralized vs. distributed approaches
2. Explore algorithms: Token Bucket, Leaky Bucket, Fixed Window Counter, Sliding Window
3. Consider data storage options: Redis, database, in-memory
4. Address synchronization and consistency challenges

**Follow-up Questions:**
1. How would you handle clock synchronization issues across multiple servers?
2. What happens if the rate limiter itself becomes a bottleneck?
3. How would you ensure the solution is highly available?
4. How would you handle different rate limits for different types of users or API endpoints?

**Behavioral Questions:**
1. Tell me about a complex system you designed. What were the key challenges and how did you overcome them?
2. How do you mentor junior developers?
3. Describe a situation where you had to make a difficult technical trade-off.
4. How do you stay current with industry trends and new technologies?
