# Java DSA Guide - Summary of Contents

We've created a comprehensive learning guide for Java programming and Data Structures & Algorithms, designed to take you from a beginner to being prepared for coding interviews. Here's a summary of the content:

## 1. Project Structure

The repository is organized into the following main sections:

- **Java Basics**: Fundamental Java programming concepts
- **Object-Oriented Programming**: Core OOP principles in Java
- **Data Structures & Algorithms**: Implementation and analysis of various data structures and algorithms
- **Coding Challenges**: Practice problems and interview questions
- **Resources**: Books, websites, and other learning materials

## 2. Content Created

### Java Basics
- **Setup and Introduction**: Installing JDK, setting up an IDE, first Hello World program
- **Variables and Data Types**: Primitive types, reference types, operators
- **Control Flow**: Conditionals, loops, and control statements
- **Methods**: Declaration, parameters, return types, overloading, recursion
- **Arrays**: Declaration, manipulation, multi-dimensional arrays, common operations

### Object-Oriented Programming
- **Classes and Objects**: Creating classes, instantiating objects, constructors, access modifiers

### Data Structures
- **Arrays and Strings**: Operations, time complexity, common techniques, practice problems
- **Hash Tables**: Implementation details, operations, practical applications

### Resources
- **Books**: Comprehensive list of Java and DSA books for all skill levels
- **Websites**: Online resources, practice platforms, and communities
- **GitHub Setup**: Instructions for pushing the guide to GitHub

### Coding Challenges
- **Top Interview Questions**: Curated list of common coding interview problems by category and difficulty
