## What's New in This Guide

We've recently expanded the repository with comprehensive content on advanced algorithms and data structures:

1. **Sorting Algorithms** - Complete guide to various sorting algorithms, their implementations, time & space complexity analysis, and when to use each.

2. **Searching Algorithms** - Detailed explanations of linear search, binary search, and other advanced search techniques with practical applications.

3. **Recursion** - In-depth coverage of recursion concepts, patterns, and optimization techniques to solve problems efficiently.

4. **Dynamic Programming** - Comprehensive guide to DP approach, state design, memoization, tabulation, and solving classic DP problems.

5. **Greedy Algorithms** - Explanations of greedy technique, common problems, and implementation approaches for optimization problems.

6. **Graph Algorithms** - Complete coverage of graph representations, traversals, shortest path algorithms, MSTs, and advanced graph concepts.

These new additions provide a stronger foundation for technical interviews and help solidify algorithmic thinking.
